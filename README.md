## Application Overview

**Tamashachi** is a modern web application designed to streamline the online ticket booking process. From the name and logo to the color palette and concept, everything is originally designed by me. This platform was developed to address the shortcomings of existing solutions in the field, while offering a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

All cultural and artistic events nationwide are accessible via the Search tab, with features such as search, filtering, and detailed event data ‚Äî including pricing, showtimes, and seat selection.
